### Hi there 👋

I'm Adebiyi Adedotun Lukman, a Frontend and User Interface Engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria.

I'm currently employed at Kobo360, as a Frontend Engineer where I work on the Customer and Partner Dashboard from raw design specs to a functional aggregated experience.

## Publications

I like to write about the tools I use in my everyday development. It could be how I learned them, solved some challenges I had with them, or just pure opinionated pieces on how I get things done with them.
