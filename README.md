### Hi there 👋

I'm Adebiyi Adedotun Lukman, a Frontend and User Interface Engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria.

I'm currently employed at Kobo360, as a Frontend Engineer where I work on the Customer and Partner Dashboard from raw design specs to a functional aggregated experience.

## Publications

I like to write about the tools I use in my everyday development. It could be how I learned them, solved some challenges I had with them, or just pure opinionated pieces on how I get things done with them.

## Books

Books have — and continue to be — been a major part of my life and growth. What started out as an habit has grown into a passion I'd forever hold on to. From my first purchase, Joys of Motherhood, to many more, I've been lucky enough to transcend my physical space, go back in time, and fast-forward to the future. Just because I can.
