### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adebiyi Adedotun Lukman, a Frontend and User Interface Engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria.

I'm currently employed at Kobo360, as a Frontend Engineer where I work closely with David and Toye on the Customer and Partner Dashboard from raw design specs to a functional aggregated experience.
